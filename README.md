# BinaryHaarWavelet_DeepNeuralNetwork
Binary version of adaptive Haar Wavelet based Grasshopper Optimization algorithm and Deep Neural Network
Highlights of the work:

1) As the number of parameters deciding the loss landscape is very large for big and complex problems, the optimization algorithm must resist various drawbacks among them maintaing exploration and exploitation is very cumbersome. Quoting this issue, Adaptive Haar wavelet is used with tunnable parameters for mitigating this issue. 

2) Learning rate Annealing is potentially a good competitor for classical learning rate schedulers but main problem pertaining to that is correct selection of optimal hyerparameters, so in this work we try qualify the drawback.

3) Adam to SGD shift is employed by sensing the landscape.

4) Commonality based Staggered representation method to avoid local minima trap.
